# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests
This notebook implements tree-based models on the heart disease dataset: 
The dataset is uploaded and loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Data structure and missing values are checked.
Features (X) and target (y) are defined, with target indicating heart disease presence (1) or absence (0).
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
A Decision Tree Classifier is trained, evaluated, and visualized.
Tree depth is tuned to analyze overfitting.
A Random Forest Classifier is trained and its performance compared with the Decision Tree.
Feature importance is plotted to show the most influential variables.
Cross-validation is performed for both models to ensure stable accuracy
